COMPOSITION_SPEC_PROMPT = """
You are an expert system architect. Your task is to design a multi-step workflow to accomplish a complex user goal by composing existing tools.
You will be given a user goal and a list of available tool templates. You must design a `CompositionSpec` that breaks the goal into a sequence of steps, where each step uses one of the available tools.

**Available Tool Templates:**
```json
{{available_tools_json}}
```

**User Goal:**
"{{goal}}"

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the user goal and break it down into a logical sequence of steps.
2.  For each step, select the most appropriate tool from the "Available Tool Templates".
3.  Define the data flow between steps. The output of one step can be used as the input to a subsequent step.
4.  Construct a `CompositionSpec` JSON object that describes this workflow.
5.  Pay close attention to the `bind` and `foreach` fields to correctly wire the pipeline.
    - Use `$variable_name` to refer to a global pipeline input.
    - Use `$step_id.output_name` to refer to the output of a previous step.
    - Use `$item` to refer to the current item in a `foreach` loop.

**You must output EXACTLY one JSON object and nothing else.**
- No markdown code fences.
- No explanation.
- No surrounding keys like {"CompositionSpec": ...}.
- Must include required keys: "pipeline_id", "description", "inputs", "steps".
- All strings must be valid JSON strings (no unescaped newlines).
- Do NOT use "+" concatenation, "$( )", or any template syntax inside JSON.

**CompositionSpec JSON Format:**
- "pipeline_id" (str): A unique, descriptive name for the workflow (e.g., "fs.find_and_copy.v1").
- "description" (str): A sentence describing what the workflow does.
- "inputs" (dict[str, str]): A dictionary of the global inputs the entire pipeline needs (e.g., {"root_dir": "path"}).
- "steps" (list[dict]): A list of step objects.
  - "id" (str): A unique ID for the step (e.g., "find_files").
  - "tool_id" (str): The ID of the tool template to use for this step (e.g., "fs.search_files.v1").
  - "bind" (dict[str, str]): Maps the tool's input parameters to values from the context (e.g., {"root_dir": "$root_dir"}).
  - "foreach" (str, optional): The context variable to loop over (e.g., "$find_files.files").
  - "outputs" (dict[str, str], optional): Names the output of this step for later use (e.g., {"files": "list[path]"}).
- "global_postconditions" (list[str]): A list of conditions that must be true after the entire pipeline succeeds.
- "failure_policy" (list[dict]): Rules for handling failures.

Example:
Goal: "Find all text files in a directory and copy them to a backup folder."
```json
{
  "pipeline_id": "fs.find_and_copy.v1",
  "description": "Finds all text files in a directory and copies them to a backup folder.",
  "inputs": {
    "root_dir": "path",
    "backup_dir": "path"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "find_text_files",
      "tool_id": "fs.search_files.v1",
      "bind": {
        "root_dir": "$root_dir",
        "pattern": "*.txt",
        "recursive": "true"
      },
      "outputs": {
        "found_paths": "list[path]"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "copy_found_files",
      "tool_id": "fs.copy.v1",
      "foreach": "$find_text_files.found_paths",
      "bind": {
        "src_path": "$item",
        "dst_path": "$backup_dir"
      }
    }
  ],
  "global_postconditions": [
    "all_found_files_exist_in_backup_dir: true"
  ],
  "failure_policy": [
    {
      "on_step": "copy_found_files",
      "action": "continue"
    }
  ]
}
Return JSON only.
