No, "Function Gemma" (specifically the `fg_llm` client in the code) is used for "tool-gap analysis" in the "Generate Single Tool" mode to recommend existing tools or suggest new ones.

In the "Autonomous Tool Creation" mode you are currently in:
*   **Goal Generation:** The goal ("Create a tool that moves files based on a search pattern...") is generated by the `spec_llm` client, which is typically an Ollama model like `llama3.2` (based on the default configuration).
*   **CompositionSpec Generation:** The `CompositionSpec` itself is also generated by the `spec_llm` client.

So, while an LLM is definitely generating these, it's not the one referred to as "Function Gemma" in the code, but rather the `spec_llm` (Ollama Client) that's handling these creative generation tasks.
